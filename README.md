# Social_Opinion_MPMFG
Attempted recreation of the simulation of the social opinion multi-population mean field game (MPMFG) from this paper (they did not release their code):

R. A. Banez, H. Gao, L. Li, C. Yang, Z. Han and H. V. Poor, "Modeling and Analysis of Opinion Dynamics in Social Networks Using Multiple-Population Mean Field Games," in IEEE Transactions on Signal and Information Processing over Networks, vol. 8, pp. 301-316, 2022, doi: 10.1109/TSIPN.2022.3166102.

See the PDF in this repository for an explanation of how the ambiguities from the paper were resolved.
